## Getting started: server

Make sure you have [Python â‰¥3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

These steps should be in a terminal in the /server folder (`cd server`).

### Set up virtual environment

This should be a one-time task.

```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
```

### Activate virtual environment

This should be done every time you open a new terminal

Unix (Linux, Mac, or Windows Subsystem on Linux):

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Git Bash on Windows:

```bash
source venv/Scripts/activate
```

Powershell:

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install project dependencies

Next, we need to install the project dependencies, which are listed in `requirements.txt`.

```
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set your database password

Change `.env` to your match your datbase address, password, etc.

### Start the server

Start the server on port 4000:

```
flask run -p 4000
```

## Tips

To test the backend, you can use the application [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

## Getting started: client

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Now, in a separate terminal in the /client folder (`cd client`), run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

The website will be available at http://localhost:5000.

If that doesn't work, try:

```
npm run build
npm run serve
```
